This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the logistic differential equation. The neural network is trained to approximate the solution by minimizing the residuals of the differential equation and boundary conditions. Once trained, the model's output is visualized in real-time using OpenGL, displaying the solution curve within an interactive window. This approach allows for both solving and visualizing complex differential equations efficiently.
